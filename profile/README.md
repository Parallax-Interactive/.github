# WELCOME TO PRISMATIC INTERACTIVE GITHUB
We're a passionate team of developers, artists, and designers dedicated to creating immersive gaming experiences that push the boundaries of imagination. Creators of the SUBJECT SERIES

## The Beginning
We were originally founded in October 2022 with the idea of Subject 9. Subject 9 was to be a small, open-world game taking place in an abandoned nuclear power facility. The young protagonist was to be confused about why they were there, meeting many horrifying monstrosities in his attempt to escape. The game was originally to be created by a sole developer, who later founded Parallax Interactive.

## Growing the Vision
Through the coming months, the storyline of Subject 9 became deeper and more complex. Leading into the new year of 2023, the story grew past the ability of one developer. Here, the first members of the team were hired. From the beginning of 2023 to the next fall, the project expanded more and more. Finally, in September of 2023, real production began with the 3D modelers. The storyline for the game was well developed by this point and extremely unique.

## Development Phase
January of 2024 marked the beginning of the development portion. By this point, Flydog Games, a former name of Prismatic Interactive, had well over a dozen team members, some of whom took on multiple positions. Throughout this year, an obvious problem became apparent: Subject 9 became too large to handle for such a new team. In the fall of 2024, two major events happened. First, the complete redesign of Flydog Games, moving into a more mature environment under Parallax Interactive. Secondly, the project of Subject 9 was postponed, and our new priority shifted to building an awesome community with high-quality games behind our name.

## Our Current Position
Our current position is described in four places: Team development, community growth, founding our LLC, and building a reputable name for said LLC. Team development has always been an issue for us, so creating smaller, successful games can draw more attention from experienced developers. Community growth is crucial in producing such a marketable and story-rich game. We see founding our LLC as necessary for tackling big projects like the SUBJECT series. Lastly, building a reputable name is the most important step, as it captures all the previously mentioned goals.
